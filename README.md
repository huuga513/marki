Study in Anki is limited to the currently selected deck as well as any subdecks it contains.

On the decks screen, your decks and subdecks will be displayed in a list. New, Learn, and Due (To Review) cards for that day will be also displayed here.

In marki, deck = directory, subdeck = subdirectory

Each time marki opens a md file, it parsers cards written in special format and figure out their status in database. Marki cares about just contents. In other words, two cards written in different places but with same contents are treated as one card. However, marki never deletes any card from database automaticlly. A gc that can be triggered by user is planned.
